        My hobby is Archery. Archery is the art, sport, practice, or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows. The experience of archery is amazing since you can release a arrow onto a target. Before I did any of this i was just a kid sitting in home doing nothing. One evening my parents dropped me at an archery center. I was handed a bow and arrows. They teached me how to shoot and aim at my target. When I shot the arrow it landed on the target. Ever since that day i went to archery classes. You should try it too!
